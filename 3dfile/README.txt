Self-balancing robot framework by Mczapla on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7091364

Summary:
This was originally just the lower base including motor mounts for a self-balancing robot.Later, I added two versions of the upper level.One holds an Arduino Nano and the other version holds an ESP32 C3 Super Mini.Both attach to the bottom side of the upper level.If necessary, there are pegs underneath for an optional rubber band or other strap to hold the controller in place.Also attached underneath is a GY521 MPU6050 gyro/accelerometer, centered over the axles.It is held in place with a snap-fit clip onto pegs.Since this configuration behaves like an inverted pendulum, the two 18650 batteries are placed on top.The motors are the typical 3 to 6 volt DC motors available online for this small class of bot.200RPM with 1:48 gear ratioMine were purchased here:   https://shorturl.at/pbPaDThe motors fit snug vertically and additional platforms can be added using the four 1/4 inch holes in the corners of the base.I also added a mid-level platform for possible future accessories.The upper levels are attached with 1/4 inch acrylic dowels.Mine were 12 inch long but I cut them in half.The actual diameter was a little undersize at 5.94mm.7-15-25  Added mounting holes for L298N H-bridge driver board.7-30-25  Added two upper levels and one optional mid-level.If interested, I sourced additional material here:Acrylic rods:  https://shorturl.at/700zyPower toggle switch:  https://shorturl.at/KE1M6L298N motor driver:  https://tinyurl.com/yfstfn7z18650 battery holder:  https://shorturl.at/lugtkMPU6050:  https://shorturl.at/7W137Nano:  https://shorturl.at/SOAB8ESP32 C3:  https://shorturl.at/MWuzO
